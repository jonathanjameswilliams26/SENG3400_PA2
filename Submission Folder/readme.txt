HOW TO SETUP THE APPLICATIONS
--------------------------------------
1. Open the "conversion service" folder and copy the "currency" folder into you Tomcat Webapps directory
2. Open the "identity service" folder and copy the "identity" folder into your Tomcat Webapps directory
3. Run the admin client or conversion client applications inside their respective folders.


IMPORTANT NOTE:
Please be aware that the "Client.java" file found inside the admin and conversion client are the same files
but have been copied into each directory in order to meet the submission specifications for separate folders
for each application. AdminClient.java and CurrencyClient.java both extend this class as I believed inheritance 
could be used to reduce code copying for both clients in regards to input and output.
I have emailed Hayden in regards to the use of this and he let me know that this approach was fine to use and
will not be marked down. Please see Hayden for confirmation as he can show you the email or I can forward it to
you.
